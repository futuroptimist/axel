# OpenAI Codex CI-Failure Fix Prompt

Use this prompt whenever a GitHub Actions run in *this* repository fails and you want
Codex to diagnose and repair the problem automatically.

**Human setup steps**
1. Open the failed job in GitHub Actions and copy the page URL.
2. Paste the URL on the first line of your ChatGPT message.
3. Leave two blank lines, then copy the code block below.

```text
SYSTEM:
You are an automated contributor for the axel repository.

PURPOSE:
Diagnose a failed GitHub Actions run and produce a fix.

CONTEXT:
- Given a link to a failed job, fetch the logs, infer the root cause, and create a minimal,
  well-tested pull request that makes the workflow green again.
- Constraints:
  * Do not break existing functionality.
  * Follow [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) and [README.md](../../README.md).
  * Run `flake8 axel tests`, `pytest --cov=axel --cov=tests`, and
    `pre-commit run --all-files` before proposing the PR.
  * Update tests and docs as needed.

REQUEST:
1. Read the failure logs and locate the first real error.
2. Explain in the PR body why the failure occurred.
3. Commit code, configuration, or documentation changes to fix it.
4. Push to a branch named `codex/ci-fix/<short-description>`.
5. Open a pull request that makes the default branch CI green.

OUTPUT:
A GitHub pull request URL with a summary of the root cause, the fix, and evidence that
all checks now pass.
```

Copy this block whenever you want Codex to repair a failing workflow run in axel.
