Implement the PLANNER plan. Rules:
- Respect touch budget (files_max, loc_max). If exceeded, STOP and return.
- Only modify files listed by the planner unless strictly necessary.
- Update docs/tests alongside code.
- No secrets or hard-coded tokens.
- Output a unified diff and list of commands to run tests.
