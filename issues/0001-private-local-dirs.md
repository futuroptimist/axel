# Issue 0001: Support Private Local Directories

Users should be able to keep local notes and repos without publishing them. Document a workflow for creating a `local/` directory that is ignored by git and setting `AXEL_REPO_FILE=local/repos.txt`.

- [x] add instructions in README
- [x] provide example of `local/repos.txt`
 - [x] ensure repo manager works with `AXEL_REPO_FILE`
