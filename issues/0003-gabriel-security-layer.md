# Issue 0003: Integrate Gabriel Security Layer

`gabriel` acts as a security layer across projects by providing OSINT tools that help protect personal safety. Document how gabriel can be integrated with other repos listed in `repos.txt`.

- [x] add examples of using gabriel alongside `token.place` and `dspace`
- [ ] mention gabriel in future quests that involve sensitive data
- [ ] keep README entries updated as integration progresses
