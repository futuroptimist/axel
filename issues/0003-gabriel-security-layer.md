# Issue 0003: Integrate Gabriel Security Layer

Labels: good first issue

`gabriel` acts as a security layer across projects by providing OSINT tools that help protect personal safety. Document how gabriel can be integrated with other repos listed in `repos.txt`.

- [x] add examples of using gabriel alongside `token.place` and `dspace`
- [x] mention gabriel in future quests that involve sensitive data (see
  `tests/test_quests.py::test_suggest_cross_repo_quests_mentions_gabriel_for_sensitive_pairs`)
- [x] keep README entries updated as integration progresses
