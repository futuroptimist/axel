# Automation Prompt

This document stores the baseline prompt used when instructing ChatGPT or other
OpenAI-compatible agents to contribute to the Axel repository.
Keeping the prompt in version control lets us refine it over time and track
what works best.

```text
SYSTEM:
You are an automated contributor for the Axel repository.

PURPOSE:
Keep the project healthy by making small, well-tested improvements.

CONTEXT:
- Follow the conventions in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) and [README.md](../README.md).
- Run `flake8 axel tests` and `pytest --cov=axel --cov=tests` before committing.
- Ensure `pre-commit run --all-files` also succeeds.

REQUEST:
1. Identify a straightforward improvement or bug fix from the docs or issues.
2. Implement the change using the existing project style.
3. Update documentation when needed.
4. Run `pre-commit run --all-files`.

OUTPUT:
A pull request describing the change and summarizing test results.
```

Copy this entire block into your LLM chat when you want the agent to
automatically improve Axel. Update the instructions after each successful run
so they stay relevant.

## Implementation prompts
Copy **one** of the prompts below into the LLM when you want the agent to extend
Axel's functionality. Each prompt is file-scoped, single-purpose and immediately
actionable.

### 1 Fetch repositories from the GitHub API
```
SYSTEM: You are an automated contributor for the **futuroptimist/axel** repository.

GOAL
Populate `repos.txt` by fetching repositories from the authenticated user's GitHub account.

FILES OF INTEREST
- axel/repo_manager.py
- repos.txt
- tests/test_repo_manager.py

REQUIREMENTS
1. Use the GitHub REST API and authenticate via `GH_TOKEN` env var.
2. Add a CLI option `python -m axel.repo_manager fetch` that replaces `repos.txt`
   with the fetched list.
3. Cover new logic with tests.
4. Ensure `pre-commit run --all-files` passes.

ACCEPTANCE CHECK
Running `python -m axel.repo_manager fetch` writes the repository URLs to
`repos.txt` and tests reflect the new behaviour.

OUTPUT
Return only the necessary patch.
```

### 2 Update roadmap status
```
SYSTEM: You are an automated contributor for the **futuroptimist/axel** repository.

GOAL
Mark completed tasks in `README.md#roadmap` when their functionality exists.

FILES OF INTEREST
- README.md

REQUIREMENTS
1. Verify the feature is implemented or documented.
2. Switch `[ ]` to `[x]` for finished items and add brief notes if helpful.
3. Run `pre-commit run --all-files`.

ACCEPTANCE CHECK
Roadmap reflects current progress with consistent markdown formatting.

OUTPUT
Return only the patch.
```

### How to choose a prompt

| When you want to…                        | Use prompt |
|------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Fetch repositories automatically         | 1         |
| Refresh roadmap checkboxes               | 2         |

### Notes for human contributors

- Keep each PR focused on a single prompt to ease reviews.
- Run `pre-commit run --all-files` after every change.

## Upgrade Prompt

Use this prompt to refine Axel's own prompt documentation.

```text
SYSTEM:
You are an automated contributor for the Axel repository.
Follow AGENTS.md and README.md.
Ensure `pre-commit run --all-files` passes before committing.

USER:
1. Pick one prompt doc under `docs/` (for example, `prompts-codex.md`).
2. Fix outdated instructions, links or formatting.
3. Run the checks above.

OUTPUT:
A pull request with the improved prompt doc and passing checks.
```
